# healthcare-insights-visualization
This project aims to build a healthcare performance dashboard based on historical data from thousands of patients across multiple hospitals. The primary focus is to present key healthcare performance indicators (KPIs) and deliver visual insights into operational and clinical trends.


ðŸŽ¯ Objectives (Healthcare KPIs):
Total Patients per Year
Calculates the number of patients registered each year to identify patient volume trends over time.

Total Billing per Year
Aggregates annual medical billing amounts as an indicator of financial load within the healthcare system.

Average Billing per Patient per Year
Measures the average cost per patient to evaluate the efficiency of healthcare services.

Average Length of Stay (LoS) per Year
Used to assess hospital efficiency in handling patient care over time.

ðŸ“Š Visualizations:
Vertical Bar Chart â€“ Top 5 Hospitals by Number of Patients
Displays a comparison of the five hospitals with the highest patient volume.

Horizontal Bar Chart â€“ Disease Distribution
Shows the number of cases for each major disease type (e.g., diabetes, cancer) to analyze disease prevalence.

Line Chart â€“ Patient Volume Trend by Year
Visualizes the annual trend of total patients handled by hospitals, highlighting growth or decline over time.

Pie Chart â€“ Admission Type Distribution
Illustrates the proportion of patients by type of hospital admission (Elective, Emergency, Urgent) as an indicator of operational load.
