# Healthcare KPI Dashboard

This project aims to build a comprehensive healthcare performance dashboard using historical data from thousands of patients across multiple hospitals. It focuses on visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) to deliver actionable insights into clinical and operational trends.

   Calculates the number of patients registered each year to identify patient volume trends over time.

2. **Total Billing per Year**  
   Aggregates annual medical billing amounts as an indicator of financial load within the healthcare system.

3. **Average Billing per Patient per Year**
