# Healthcare KPI Dashboard

This project aims to build a comprehensive healthcare performance dashboard using historical data from thousands of patients across multiple hospitals. It focuses on visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) to deliver actionable insights into clinical and operational trends.

---

## Objectives (Healthcare KPIs)

1. **Total Patients per Year**  
   Calculates the number of patients registered each year to identify patient volume trends over time.

2. **Total Billing per Year**  
   Aggregates annual medical billing amounts as an indicator of financial load within the healthcare system.

3. **Average Billing per Patient per Year**  
   Measures the average cost per patient to evaluate the efficiency of healthcare services.

4. **Average Length of Stay (LoS) per Year**  
   Assesses hospital efficiency in handling patient care duration.

## Visualizations

1. **Vertical Bar Chart – Top 5 Hospitals by Number of Patients**  
   Displays the hospitals with the highest patient volumes.

2. **Horizontal Bar Chart – Disease Distribution**  
   Shows the number of cases per disease type to analyze prevalence.

3. **Line Chart – Patient Volume Trend by Year**  
   Visualizes annual changes in patient count.

4. **Pie Chart – Admission Type Distribution**  
   Illustrates the proportion of patients by admission type (Elective, Emergency, Urgent).
